-- 3. Removing null and Blank Values
-- For removing null values, firstly need to understand the data structure where the null values present
select * from layoff_staging2
where total_laid_off is null and percentage_laid_off is null;-- checking whether both column is common null values
select distinct industry from layoff_staging2;

select * from layoff_staging2
where industry is null or industry='';-- checking both null and black values availability

select * from layoff_staging2
where company="carvana";-- finding that particular company 

select * from layoff_staging2 t1
join layoff_staging2 t2
on t1.company=t2.company
where (t1.industry is null or t1.industry='')
and t1.industry is not null; -- findind the null values present using join

select t1.industry,t2.industry from layoff_staging2 t1
join layoff_staging2 t2
on t1.company=t2.company
where (t1.industry is null or t1.industry='')
and t1.industry is not null;

update layoff_staging2
set industry=null
where industry=''; -- firstly change blank into null values

update layoff_staging2 t1
join layoff_staging2 t2
on t1.company=t2.company
set t1.industry=t2.industry
where t1.industry is null 
and t1.industry is not null; -- later we can update here 

select * from layoff_staging2
where total_laid_off is null and 
percentage_laid_off is null; -- checking rows with null values

delete from layoff_staging2
where total_laid_off is null and 
percentage_laid_off is null; -- deleteing rows with null values
